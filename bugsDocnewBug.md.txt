When I started high school most class were being held online, originally I went in person for the first half and the second half of the school day online. 
Eventually I did online school for the rest of my first year.
It was hard to adept as I wasn't really conformable with using microscoff teams, which caused me to struggle at first, but was able to finish my classes for the first year.
